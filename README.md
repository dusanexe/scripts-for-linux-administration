# scripts-for-linux-administration
i will create some my ideas that i think can be useful for linux administration


basictasks.sh

  is script that will create basic informations of running system and it will be saved in day_base directory named by current date. Every time script will create another     file in same folder when script is runned by new day.



listuser.sh

  is script that will ask u for input of a date to check list of users logged in on that day.
