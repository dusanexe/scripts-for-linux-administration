# scripts-for-linux-administration
i will create some my ideas that i think can be useful for linux administration



basictasks.sh

  is script that will create basic informations of running system and it will be saved in day_base directory named by current date. Every time script will create another     file in same folder when script is runned by new day.



listuser.sh

  is script that will ask u for input of a date to check list of users logged in on that day.




cpuusage

  read cpu usage from processes from top command and prints current status, can be used for status bar.. etc..
  
  

mem

 print: "Total:15Gi Used:1.0Gi Free:13Gi Shar:137Mi Cache:696Mi" of current memory status, also can be used for status bar in one line...
